# Moonshot

This is a basic moon landing game made for the Itch.io 2020 Game Off running during November 2020,
made with Pixi.js and Typescript. The theme of the game off was "moonshot", which I took literally
and decided to make a game about landing on the moon.

## How to play
The game is available to play at https://trymunx.github.io/moonshot. To play, click and drag anywhere on the screen
to launch the rocket. The angle at which you release the rocket will be the direction it is launched in, and the aim
is to land on the moon. If you are travelling too fast (the speed is higher than in the green area on the 
speedometer), you will crash! To score a point, land safely on the moon without crashing by launching at an
angle and speed that will take you close enough to just orbit the moon without crashing directly.
More points can be earned by consecutive successful trips between the earth and the moon. Watch out for asteroids!
