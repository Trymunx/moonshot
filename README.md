# Moonshot

This is a basic moon landing game made for the Itch.io 2020 Game Off running during November 2020,
made with Pixi.js and Typescript. The theme of the game off was "moonshot", which I took literally
and decided to make a game about landing on the moon.

### To run development build
This project uses parcel, so with that installed globally you can run `parcel src/index.html` and visit
http://localhost:1234 to see the running game.
